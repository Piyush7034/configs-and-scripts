CredentialConfig:
1. Remove context and credentialType from primary key as for mso_mdoc and vc+sd-jwt VCs context and credentialType is not required.
2. Add the respective condition in the service layer for ldp_vc.
3. (Optional) Make credentialConfigKeyId to be the primary key in place of context, credentialType and format combined.

CredentialFormat:
ldp_vc => credentialSubject is mandatory.
mso_mdoc => claims and doctype is mandatory.
vc+sd-jwt => 1. Claims is mandatory
             2. New field 'vct' is needed in CredentialConfig.

CertifyIssuanceServiceImpl Changes for sd-jwt:
1. Does not have credentialDefinition.
2. Removing validateLdpVc method in vc+sd-jwt case while fetching credential as credentialDefinition is not present in sd-jwt vc. 
    Hence also removing credentialType and context dependency that is a must in ldp_vc format VCs
3. Remove vc+sd-jwt condition in getScopeCredentialMapping

Credential Subject keys and order must be same.
